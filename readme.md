Work in progress! :construction:

Lighthouse score: **100**

Hacker News PWA - Inclusive Edition is a Hacker News PWA implementation built with inclusivity and accessibility in mind.

This application is built using Service Worker Rendering on top of Server Side Rendering. There is no JavaScript running in the page context, except to register the service worker. [You can read about Service Worker Rendering in more detail here](https://github.com/robwebdev/blog/blob/master/swr.md).
